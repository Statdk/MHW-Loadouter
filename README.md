# MHW-Loadouter

A small armor assembly tool for the game Monster Hunter World written to be statically served.

The project is available on my [Github Pages](https://www.statdk.com/MHW-Loadouter), but is able to be hosted locally (or anywhere else you can serve http requests).


## Features

 - Searching for equipment by name and rank
 - Saving and deleting custom equipment sets
 - 


## How to use


## Running Locally

Depending on your browser, you may be able to simply download the project source and open `index.html` with your file manager.
Many browsers, however, will deny the page access to the other javascript files in the project. 
To get around this, the project possesses an npm project script to serve the page with the http-server package.


### Serving the page locally




## Unimplemented

 - Armor Decorations
 - Armor Damage Calculations
 - Weapon Selection
